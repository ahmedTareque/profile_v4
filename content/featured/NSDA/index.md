An admirable initiative taken by the agency(NSDA) under <span style="color: var(--green);">the Prime Minister's Office </span>for developing policies to build a skilled labour force and to send them througout the world. This <span style="color: var(--green);">National Skills Portal (NSP)</span> was created by NSDA with the intention of methodically gathering, organizing, analyzing, and disseminating data on all variables associated with the nation's skills development ecosystem.
